## Who am I

I currently have 1 active student, so still have room for 1 or maybe 2 more.

I have experience at American Express, profitable VC-backed startups / Kustomer, FAANG Meta.
I've gone to a bootcamp, and was chosen to stay as a Teaching Assistant, interviewing future bootcamp students to see if they would be a good fit, also have 8 years of experiencing tutoring SAT and test prep.

## Who I help

You're a student learning computer science and it started off great, but now the teacher is just going way too fast and you don't get what's going on anymore.

You're a college or bootcamp graduate who is struggling with getting your foot in the door. You send out hundreds of applications but hear nothing back.

You're not currently working as an engineer, but you are interested in tech and wondering if switching is the right choice.

You're a junior or mid-level engineer, but want some actionable career advice on how to get promoted to Senior.
