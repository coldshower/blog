        I'm John, a software engineer with <strong>6+ years of experience</strong> at companies like Meta, American
        Express, and venture funded startups like Skiplagged and Kustomer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you're here, I'm assuming you either want tutoring or mentorship, or are just taking a look! Either way,
        welcome to my home on the internet.

  <h2>What do you need help with?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You're a student learning computer science and it started off great, but now the teacher is just going way too
      fast and you don't get what's going on anymore.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're a college or bootcamp graduate who is struggling with getting your foot in the door. You send out hundreds
      of applications but hear nothing back.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're not currently working as an engineer, but you are interested in tech and wondering if switching is the
      right choice.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're a junior or mid-level engineer, but want some actionable career advice on how to get promoted to Senior.
    </li>
  </ul>
