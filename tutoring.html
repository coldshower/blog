<p>
  Hello and welcome! I'm John and I've been a software engineer for more than six years, with experience at Meta,
  American Express, and venture backed startups like Skiplagged and Kustomer. I have a huge passion for teaching because
  it helps ensure a brighter future.

<h2>What you need help with</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    You're a student learning computer science and it started off great, but now the teacher is just going way too fast
    and you don't get what's going on anymore.
  </li>
  <li>
    You're a college or bootcamp graduate who is struggling with getting your foot in the door. You send out hundreds of
    applications but hear nothing back.
  </li>
  <li>
    You're not currently working as an engineer, but you are interested in tech and wondering if switching is the right
    choice.
  </li>
  <li>
    You're a junior or mid-level engineer, but want some actionable career advice on how to get promoted to Senior.
  </li>
</ul>
