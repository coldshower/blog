<h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>

<p>
  I'm John and I've been a software engineer for more than six years, with experience at Meta, American Express, and
  venture backed startups like Skiplagged and Kustomer. I have a huge passion for teaching because it helps ensure a
  brighter future.

<h2>What you need help with</h2>

You're a student learning computer science and it started off great, but now the teacher is just going way too fast and
you don't get what's going on anymore. You're a college or bootcamp graduate who is struggling with getting your foot in
the door. You send out hundreds of applications but hear nothing back. You're not currently working as an engineer, but
you are interested in tech and wondering if switching is the right choice. You're a junior or mid-level engineer, but
want some actionable career advice on how to get promoted to Senior.

<h2>How to get in touch</h2>

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>I currently have 1 active student, so still have room for 1 or maybe 2 more.</p>

I've gone to a bootcamp, and was chosen to stay as a Teaching Assistant, interviewing future bootcamp students to see if
they would be a good fit, also have 8 years of experiencing tutoring SAT and test prep.
