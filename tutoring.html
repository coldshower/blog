  <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
  <div class="intro-wrapper">
    <p>
      I'm John and I've been a software engineer for 6+ years at companies like Meta, American Express, and venture
      funded startups like Skiplagged and Kustomer. I have a huge passion for teaching because it helps ensure a
      brighter future.

  <h2>What you need help with, and what I can do for you</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You're a student learning computer science and it started off great, but now the teacher is just going way too
      fast and you don't get what's going on anymore.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're a college or bootcamp graduate who is struggling with getting your foot in the door. You send out hundreds
      of applications but hear nothing back.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're not currently working as an engineer, but you are interested in tech and wondering if switching is the
      right choice.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're a junior or mid-level engineer, but want some actionable career advice on how to get promoted to Senior.
    </li>
  </ul>
