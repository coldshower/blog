        I'm John, a software engineer with <strong>6+ years of experience</strong> at companies like Meta, American
        Express, and venture funded startups like Skiplagged and Kustomer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you're here, I'm assuming you either want tutoring or mentorship, or are just taking a look! Either way,
        welcome to my home on the internet.

    You're learning computer science and it started off great, but now the material is going too fast and you don't get
    what's going on anymore.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>How I can help:</strong> Computer science requires a strong foundation, but once you have that foundation,
      you can learn almost any of it by yourself. I'll help you by identifying what you are getting confused by, and
      coming up with exercises and examples for you to learn by doing.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You're a college or bootcamp graduate who is struggling with getting your foot in the door. You send out 100s of
    applications but hear nothing back, or you're doing interviews and aren't getting any offers.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>How I can help:</strong> I've been in this position myself, and I've coached several other bootcamp
      graduates who now all are employed. We can take a look at your profile together, and I can share some advice on
      how to stand out and be an exceptional candidate, even without prior industry experience.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You're a solid engineer, but you still haven't been promoted to senior, and you want some real actionable advice on
    how to do it.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>How I can help:</strong> As someone who has been promoted to senior engineer before, I know firsthand how
      confusing the criteria for senior engineer can be. Usually technical chops are not what's lacking. Instead, it's
      more about behaviors and habits. We'll review your work routine and I can provide some advice on where you can
      make adjustments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    Knowing how to code has transformed my life. It's provided me abundant career opportunities. It's allowed me to meet
    some of my best friends. And it may be the most powerful tool for creation we have today. All the instructors and
    resources I've ever learned from gave me one of the biggest gifts I could have ever received, and I want to be able
    to give that gift to the future generation of engineers too.
  </p>

  <p>Here's why I think I would be a good tutor or mentor for you.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      I've been a software engineer for 6+ years at companies like Meta, American Express, and more. I have real
      experience both at large companies and small, <strong>building applications used by hundreds of millions of people</strong>.

    <li>
      I also have <strong>many years of real teaching experience</strong>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          After graduating from Fullstack Academy, I was chosen to be a Teaching Assistant and help teach the next class
          for 3 months.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2021, I was a Volunteer Instructor for Code Nation, where I helped teach NYC public high school students
          how to code after school over 9 months. By the end, they were able to create their own interactive websites
          with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>For 2 years, I taught SAT test prep at a private cram school.</li>
