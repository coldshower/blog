We're having dinner, and my younger sister decides to break the silence with, “I have an idea for a website.”

“Oh, really? What?” By the tone of her voice, I knew this wasn’t another spur of the moment type idea. She had put a lot of thought into this nugget.

“It’s a website where people can go and put in the ‘me’ part of the kermit meme, and the website returns a completed meme with the ‘inner me’ response.”

“Oh I see. So the website would return ‘inner me’ responses that people have already written before on the internet.” 

Hm…

Naturally, my brain is already racing to think up ways to implement the idea, and I’m thinking that there will be a database storing all “me” and “inner me” entries scraped from the internet. Since the kermit frog meme is usually an image, I’ll probably have to run the results of the scraper through Optical Character Recognition in order to get the text. 

Then, I’m thinking, “So what if the ‘me’ entry has never been done before?”

Before she answers, my brain has already chimed in with another idea and I start thinking of using machine learning on past responses to create a fitting response to the new entry. 

Her voice pulls me back to reality. 

“There would be a loading screen, and,” she tries to suppress a chuckle, “I would be alerted about someone making a never-before-seen entry and I would just come up with something right then and there.”

Of course. 

In my mental engineering stupor, I had forgotten about simpler, timeless solutions. The solutions that don’t scale. This wasn’t a new concept to me. I had done something similar before, where in an attempt to increase the recycling of plastic bags, I had made a website where people could sign up to have their extra plastic bags picked up and delivered to a suitable recycling center. All the website actually did was send me an email with the pick-up location, where I would ride my own bike to pick up the bags and bring them to the recycling center myself. 

I was slightly upset at myself for jumping so far ahead so quickly and missing the more elegant solution, but I’m still grateful that I was made aware of it, now rather than later. As a software engineer, or any engineer, it’s very easy to fall into the trap of thinking of how to use conventional principles in order to save time, like scraping the web vs inputting all the memes yourself, but in business, it is much more difficult to assess what is right and wrong. Even as an engineer, it’s good to keep that “inner me” duct tape programmer in you alive.
