One of the most common complaints I see from people fresh on the job market is that they keep getting rejected because the company ended up wanting someone with more experience. 

Their reasoning seems sound. 

*How can I get experience if all jobs require me to already have experience?*

The problem with this mindset is that it shifts the blame onto the big evil system, and prevents them from realizing the actual reason for the rejection.

Yeah that's right it's themselves.

When companies say they want someone with more experience, what they really mean is that they want someone who seems more *competent* than you. At the end of the day, you must try to understand the motivations of other people. Why should a company hire you? Why should this hiring manager want you to join his/her company? 

Ultimately, the truths are fairly basic. A company wants to hire a person who can generate more money than the salary he/she gets paid. A manager wants to hire someone onto his team who will make him look good to his own manager. A future colleague wants to hire someone who he/she can imagine enjoying a workday with and possibly learn something from. As long as you are able to fulfill the motivations of the people making the decision to hire you or not, you will consistently be able to get a job because you are both competent and valuable in their eyes.

For example, imagine that during an interview, instead of being fresh out of college, you had 5 years of experience. How would that interview go differently? If you think about it, the real reason why that interview would feel more successful is due to the fact that you have stories about challenges and successes to prove your competence and value. Now, instead of having nothing to say when they ask if you have experience doing XYZ, you have a rich story to share. The actual number of years of experience you have is trivial in comparison. 

#### *Okay great, but now what?*

The job search is basically broken down into three parts, and to be successful, you need to increase the competence indicators of each

### Discovery

This is the process of getting noticed by an employer. You can optimize this process by
- networking correctly - pretty much everyone gets this wrong
- having as strong an online profile as you can (linkedin, personal website, social media) - most people have none
- having an attractive resume - most people undersell themselves heavily

### Assessment

This is the interview process. How well you do here will be based on 
- your preparation for standard behavioral questions - most people are unaware of just how much preparation should be done for these
- your preparation for technical questions - many people, even when they can answer the questions, fail to present their answers in the right way. Different companies can have different preferences
- your interview and communication skills

### Completion

This is the first few weeks of the job, and depending on how well you perform, can change your career momentum quite substantially. This is the difference between someone who gets stuck at a junior level for years vs someone who gets fast tracked. You can do well by making sure
- you put in the effort to become an independent contributor as quickly as possible
- you make a likeable first impression

This may be a little jarring, especially if you had not considered the job search process to be so involved before, but let me tell you that you don't even need to be perfect at all of these things to finally be *competent* enough. You might just need to perform better at the behavioral parts of the interview, or maybe your resume just needs to be cleaned up. The thing is, so few people out there have considered any of this that just the fact that you know this puts you heads and shoulders above the crowd.

However, just knowing is not enough. It's what you [doooo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmwLPU5H6_Q) that makes a difference.
