As a kid, my parents had always encouraged me to keep a journal. 

Why. 

Use it to write about your day.

Not only did this not make any sense to me, but it also upset me very much because I wanted to do other things like watch television.

At first, I tried to do what I was told. I wrote about my days.

Here is close to what I would write:
I woke up at 8:00 today.
I had an egg sandwich for breakfast. It was delicious.
I went outside and rode my bike around the block 7 times.
I came back home and had lunch. I had some cereal too. It was Cheerios.
After, I watched some television. It was very exciting.
The end.

To be honest, that is probably better than the originals since I would always try to add "plot twists" to spice things up, but that was basically it. If I can find my old journals, I'll upload an actual entry from them.

Still, every additional word required tremendous effort and concentration. If I had known what writer's block was at the time, I would have said I had writer's constipation.

I just didn't think my days made for very interesting journal entries, or so I thought at the time.

Most of the books I liked were young adult fantasy novels, which I saw as "good writing". How could real life, with all its rules and limitations compare to those worlds where it seemed nothing was impossible?

So I started trying to emulate that, and rather than include what I thought were trivial details about my own life, I started to prefer to think up fantasy lands and adventures.

With this practice, I became a technically good writer for my age. My grammar and spelling were solid. I eventually went to a middle school called Mark Twain for the Gifted and Talented. Every new student was assessed in two "talents" and if he did well enough, he would attend the school specializing in that "talent". I got in for Creative Writing and I remember the essay I wrote was about a boy who traveled back to the time of the dinosaurs and right before the meteor hit the earth, the boy wakes up. I thought this was a good way to end my stories at the time, and I used it frequently. 

My creative writing teachers would have us write in journals every day as well, and from time to time, they would collect these journals to grade. For my entire first year, I did very average on these journals. I didn't really understand what was wrong with my writing. I thought I was doing the best I could, by writing about those fantasy worlds and making up stories. Didn't JK Rowling do the same thing? Would my teacher give Rowling a B-?

One day, I decided to ask my friend who I knew got good journal grades if I could borrow his journal, just for a night, to see what I could do better. 

Every word he wrote was heartfelt and inviting. All of his vulnerabilities and emotions were clearly laid out, as if he had nothing to hide. It was like the opposite of Hemingway, and I couldn't turn my eyes away. That night, I read his journal cover to cover.

And from that day, I emulated his style in my own journal entries. I started getting A after A.

As a middle schooler, I lacked the ability to express exactly what I learned.

But now I finally can.

I think the same mundane details that others experience become interesting to you because they are opportunities for a connection. To find that someone else views life in a similar way as you do is an unparalleled feeling. 

A person can see a sunset everyday, but still be moved by another person's description of a sunset.

Of course, take this advice with a single grain of salt. This applies much more to free writing than a business email. But I think if applied in the right context, you will impress yourself with just how much more immersive your writing becomes.
