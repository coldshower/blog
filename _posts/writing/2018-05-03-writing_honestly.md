As a kid, my parents had always encouraged me to keep a journal. When I asked "why", they would tell me, "use it to write about your day."

Not only did this not make any sense to me, but it also upset me very much because I wanted to do other things like watch television.

At first, I tried to do what I was told. I wrote about my days.

Here is close to what I would write:
I woke up at 8:00 today.
I had an egg sandwich for breakfast. It was delicious.
I went outside and rode my bike around the block 7 times.
I came back home and had lunch. I had some cereal too. It was Cheerios.
After, I watched some television. It was very exciting.
The end.

To be honest, that is probably better than what it actually was since I would always try to flower up the language or add "plot twists", but that was basically it. If I can find my old journals, I'll upload an actual entry from them.

Still, every additional word required tremendous effort and concentration. If I had known what writer's block was at the time, I would have said I had writer's constipation.

I just didn't think my days made for very interesting journal entries, or so I thought at the time.

Most of the books I liked were young adult fantasy novels, which was I saw as "good writing". How could real life, with all its rules and limitations compare to those worlds where it seemed nothing was impossible?

So I started trying to emulate that, and rather than write about my own life, I started to think up fantasy lands and adventures.

Later on when I started attending school, I learned that it wasn't just my parents, but also teachers who were compelled to make us write in journals.
